/* Spatialised output for the software SPU.
 *
 * The software SPU models the PlayStation's synthesis and reverb exactly, but
 * the hardware is a STEREO device, so its renderer mixes all 24 voices down to
 * L/R and its output interface is literally an interleaved stereo buffer. That
 * left surround users choosing between accurate audio and more than two
 * speakers: the legacy OpenAL backend gives them a speaker layout but only an
 * approximate reverb, and this one gives them the real reverb in stereo.
 *
 * This module removes the choice. The core still synthesises and still runs its
 * own reverb -- nothing about the emulation changes -- but instead of taking its
 * stereo downmix we take the per-voice taps, place each voice in a speaker field
 * from its own PSX pan, and let OpenAL render that field to whatever layout the
 * user actually has.
 *
 * Voices are summed into a handful of fixed-direction buses rather than getting
 * a source each. Twenty-four independently streamed sources drift the moment one
 * of them underruns, and recovering it is audible; a fixed set of buses never
 * starts or stops, so every stream stays sample-aligned for the whole session.
 *
 * The dry field stays in FRONT of the listener because that is where a stereo
 * console image belongs, and the reverb return is sent to the rear pair. That is
 * what the extra speakers are for, and it is the one part of the mix that is
 * genuinely ambient rather than positional. */
